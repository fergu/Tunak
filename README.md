 Source code for a music-guessing app originally released on the app store

This was the second of two apps I wrote and eventually released on the app store, and this one was more of a swing at a free-to-play/ad-supported game.

The generic idea was the app picked songs at random from your music library and played a short segment from a random part of the song, and you scored points based on how fast you could identify the song playing. It was heavily based off of a game with a similar mechanic that was present on the original mechanical iPods.

It never really took off, but was an excellent learning opportunity. I would not necessarily expect this code to compile, and certainly most likely not to run properly, but I am releasing it in case someone would like to revisit this idea as I always thought it was a fun game on the original iPods.

This code can be modified as you like, but the code of the result must remain open source. You are welcome to release a version to the app store with a few requirements:

1) The result MUST have been modified in some way. Don't go and just copy/paste this to the app store. If you're unsure, open an issue and I'm happy to have a discussion.

2) Attribution to me/this repository as the basis to your project

3) The code itself is made open source under the same license.
